## Setup Instructions

To set up the AI Marketplace locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nrk8286/Ai-Market.git
   cd Ai-Market
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   PAYMENT_GATEWAY_API_KEY=your_payment_gateway_api_key
   ```

4. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. **Run tests:**
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

Note: This repository includes a lightweight Node-based test runner (`scripts/run-tests.js`). Use `npm test` to run it locally — it is intentionally simple so tests run reliably when the project is nested inside other workspaces or `node_modules` folders.

Payments & Webhooks (Stripe)

- Endpoints added:
  - `POST /marketplace/checkout` — creates a demo checkout session for an item
  - `POST /webhooks/stripe` — receives Stripe webhook events (verify `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in production)

- Env vars to set: `STRIPE_API_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

Admin API

- Simple token-protected admin API added for marketplace management:
  - `GET /admin/items` — list items (requires `Authorization: Bearer <ADMIN_TOKEN>` header)
  - `POST /admin/items` — add an item
- Set `ADMIN_TOKEN` in your environment to enable admin access.

Datadog Synthetic example

- Example synthetic test file added at `datadog/synthetic_example.json`. If you use Datadog Synthetics, add `DD_API_KEY` and `DD_APP_KEY` as repo secrets and the Datadog workflow will run.

Preview deploy (CI)

- A new CI job `e2e-preview` performs a `wrangler publish --dry-run` to validate packaging and runs lightweight E2E scripts. This job is gated behind Cloudflare secrets (`CF_API_TOKEN`, `CF_ACCOUNT_ID`).

## Deploying to Cloudflare

To deploy the AI Marketplace to Cloudflare, follow these steps:

1. **Install Wrangler (if not installed):**
   ```bash
   npm install -g wrangler
   ```

2. **Authenticate Wrangler with your Cloudflare account:**
   ```bash
   wrangler login
   ```

3. **Publish the project:**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

## Integrating AI

The AI Marketplace leverages AI to fix errors and handle customer support. To integrate AI, follow these steps:

1. **Set up the OpenAI API key:**
   Ensure that the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable is set in your `.env` file.

2. **Implement AI functionalities:**
   The `worker.js` file includes routes for AI functionalities such as error fixing and customer support. Customize these routes as needed.

## Adding Graphics

To make the site visually appealing and similar to popular e-commerce platforms like Amazon or eBay, follow these steps:

1. **Add images and graphics:**
   Place images and graphics in the appropriate directories (e.g., `assets/images`).

2. **Update HTML and CSS:**
   Modify the `index.html` and `styles.css` files to include the new graphics and improve the site's design.

## Usage Examples

Here are some examples of how to use the AI Marketplace:

1. **Explore Marketplace:**
   Visit the homepage and click on the "Explore Marketplace" button to view available AI-powered tools and services.

2. **Purchase an Item:**
   Select an item from the marketplace and click the "Buy" button to proceed with the purchase.

3. **AI-Generated Content:**
   Access the AI-generated content by visiting the `/api/generate` route.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while using the AI Marketplace, consider the following troubleshooting tips:

1. **Check Environment Variables:**
   Ensure that all required environment variables are set correctly in the `.env` file.

2. **Review Logs:**
   Check the server logs for any error messages or warnings that may provide insights into the issue.

3. **Update Dependencies:**
   Ensure that all dependencies are up to date by running `npm update`.

4. **Clear Cache:**
   Clear your browser cache and cookies to resolve any caching-related issues.

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables are used in the AI Marketplace project:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: The API key for accessing OpenAI services.
- `PAYMENT_GATEWAY_API_KEY`: The API key for the payment gateway used for processing transactions.

Ensure that these environment variables are set correctly in the `.env` file before running the project.
